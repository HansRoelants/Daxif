(* For unit test to work a working environment need to be created first
 * The CRM demo needs to have example data installed
 * The related information needed are inputted in AuthInfo and along with resources needed for some unit tests
 * Resources:
 *  - PluginUnitTests
 *    Requires ILmerged plugin assembly dll with at least one type, step and image
 *    This assembly should be placed in the resource folder
 *
 *  - WorkflowUnitTests
 *    Requires ILmerged workflow assembly dll with at least one activity
 *    This assembly should be placed in the resource folder
 *
 *  - SolutionUnitTests
 *    Requires both an ILmerged plugin and workflow assembly dll 
 *    The plugin dll should contain at least one type, step and image
 *    The workflow dll should contain at least one activity
 *    These assembly should be placed in the resource folder
 *    Also requires a pakcaged solution placed in the resource folder
 *
 *  - WebResourceshelperUnitTests
 *    Requires a folder called "WebResources" placed in the resource folder
 *    This folder should contain atleast one javascript file
